[] Ajax for tracked fleets to autopull updates, saves having to refresh.
[] Select corps to track paps for, currently the way its pulling is messy.
[] Ability to delete ships from paps/papped fleets.
[] Update corp motd when fleet is being tracked? maybe unsure yet.
[] Tools to kick all members/pods from fleet
